Dear Dr. Hagen,

My name is Yong Cao, a PhD student from Dr. Meng-Qiu Dong’s lab. In 2018, you published a very nice paper (Hagen, et al. Org Biomol Chem) in which you synthesised 2 new cleavabl cross-linker and successfully applied to aldolase, the spectrum in Fig4 show very strong doublets different MS acquisition methods for DSSO cross-linked samples, developed the XLinkX 2.0 software, and set a new record of cross-link sites on HeLa lysate. In your paper, 6 out of 20 E. coli SCX fractions were used for comparing these methods. I am a beginner in DSSO cross-linking and I wonder if you could provide the raw data (6 fractions x 4 acquisition methods) to me. They’ll be very useful for me to learn how to set parameters and how to analyze data. Your kind help will be greatly appreciated. 

Best wishes,
Yong Cao
